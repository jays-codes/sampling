# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The sampling frame may be biased towards individuals who are more likely to be engaged with the university community or active on social media. This might exclude certain demographics, such as older adults who are less active online.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    It could but there are challenges and limitations:
    - Accessing detailed demographic and listening data from music streaming services may be challenging due to privacy concerns and data sharing policies.
    - Observational studies may be subject to biases and confounding variables that are harder to control compared to experimental studies.
    - Researchers have less control over the variables and conditions in observational studies, which can make it difficult to establish causality.
    ```
